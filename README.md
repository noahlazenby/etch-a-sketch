The Odin Project: Etch-a-Sketch 
My take on the Etch-a-Sketch project for The Odin Project in JavaScript. This project uses event listeners to allow the users to color the screen of boxes. The user can input their desired number of squares to create a large or smaller grid than the default. 

Improvements I would like to make in the future:
1. Add border around Etch-a-Sketch 
2. Add "Clear" function
3. Allow the user to change the color of the background
4. Add a "Rainbow" option that randomizes the background color
